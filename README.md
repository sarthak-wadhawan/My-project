# My-project
 sprint2
 I learned a lot about urdf, ros, ros2, and  about how to attach urdf importers and connectors to unity. 
 I learned how to create a urdf from scratch, how to add objects and to create a simple robot with it. 
4dof_arm.urdf is the urdf file with all the 4 links and joints(wrist,base,shoulder, and elbow are the links). I learnt about joints too.
RobotSetup.cs has the collider and rigidbody setup.
